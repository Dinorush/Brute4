# Brute 4

**Required by Server and Client**

Implements the Brute4 titan based on cut content.

### Activation

Requires **sv_cheats**. Be a Northstar and run `script GiveBrute4()` to give the loadout to the first player. Player index can be specified if desired, e.g. `script GiveBrute4(2)`.

### ConVars
Brute4 has two convars to control which titans Brute4 can be put on.

* `brute4_allowed_chassis`: Default value of `northstar`. Any titan on the list can be given Brute4. Takes a comma separated list of titan names. (Note: Monarch is `vanguard`)
* `brute4_unlock_chassis`: Default value of `0`. Set to `1` to allow any titan to be given Brute4, overriding `brute4_allowed_chassis`.
