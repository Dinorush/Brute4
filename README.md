# Brute 4

**Required by Server and Client**

Implements the Brute4 titan based on cut content.

### Activation

Equip Northstar prime; Brute4 will replace its loadout on drop.

### For Testing/Modding
With **sv_cheats** on, you can give the loadout to the first player by running `script GiveBrute4()`. Player index can be specified if desired, e.g. `script GiveBrute4(2)`. The ConVar `brute4_replace_ns_prime` can also be set to 0 to stop the mod from replacing Northstar prime automatically.
